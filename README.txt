- Can access to roullete activity so that you can choose what cuisine you want to eat : We can add food selections to the application and randomly choose between the added foods

Any information you think we should know about your submission
* Is there anything that doesn't work? Why?
- Notification/ Alarm : was individually studying and had difficult implementing it since we have not learned how to use broadcastreceiver.
- Using ML to give recommendation : We tried to use ML to give a recommendation. However due to lack of data and difficulty of implementing ML to the app, we decided to just give a basic recommendation what users should eat.
- GalleryActivity: We wanted to make GalleryActivty more like Instagram. Where you take a photo and a collection of photos taken using our app are displayed.
However, due to the lack of time, we couldn't get there. Since gallery is not our main activity, we decide to spend more times on enhancing other activities. 
- Maps and PlaceDetail activities: These activities are pretty straightforward and work seamlessly. 
- Roulette Activity - Could have better UI/ animation

* Is there anything that you did that you feel might be unclear? Explain it here.

We don't see anything that is unclear, but if we had more it would be great to add features like:
   (1) redirecting a selected restaurant to Postmates or Doordash, 
   (2) displaying a direction to the restaurant by driving or walking, 
   (3) making a reservation to the restaurant, and more.
